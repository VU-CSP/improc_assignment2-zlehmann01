    "**Task 1.**  \n",
    "    \n",
    "   From the downloaded image (`img`; file = `image_cell.tif`), make an image `img1` from just the red channel (channel 0) at time point 23 of the tensor [T,Y,X,C]  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Using `img1`, create a new image `img2` where values less than than the mean are set to the background value (calculated as the minimum intensity value in the image).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 3.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Set `img2[0:20,0:20] = np.amax(img2)` (Make a white box in the image to more easily visualize the transformation)  \n",
    "   - Compress `img2` in half, rotate it 30 degrees clockwise, and translate its `(0,0)` to `(dx,dy)=(200,100)`  \n",
    "   - Save resulting image as `img3`  \n",
    "   - Plot `img3` side-by-side with `img2`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 4.**  **EXTRA CREDIT**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Build a slider function to display different frames of an RGB image over time.  \n",
    "   - Consider 3 subplots for: 'RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE' channels\n",
    "   - Make the interactive slider for time: int with range 0 to the number of frames in video. \n",

    "-----  \n",
    "#### Using `FISH_example.tif`\n",
    "**Task 5.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Make a slice of `img_FISH` and save as `img_FISH_slice` using: `Z=10`, `Y=120:350`, `X=50:250`  \n",
    "   - Apply a Gaussian filter to `img_FISH_slice` with `sigma=1` and save it as `img_gaussian_filter_simga_1`\n",
    "   - Make difference of Gaussians filter of `img_FISH_slice` using `low_sigma=1` and `high_sigma=5` and `img_diff_gaussians`\n",
